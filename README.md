# Base-10 Analog & Digital Clocks

This project is an exploration of clocks based on base ten rather than base 60 as the Babylonian clock most commonly used is.

There are two possible displays. Both have 100 minutes per hour & 100 seconds per minute. One has ten hours in a day as the clock used during the French Revolution did. The other has 100 hours per day & the time of day is simply the percentage of the day that has passed.

To switch between clocks, just click on the face. For some reason this works in Firefox, but not in Chrome. It is also possible to switch using the '`u`' key. Also, you can add a pause between each tick *(up to one second)* with the '`p`' key.

The clock also has a year hand that tracks the progress through the year of the Sidereal Zodiac.
